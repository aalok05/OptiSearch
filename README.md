# OptiSearch
A UWP app that lets you search for words in images like 'Find in Page', using Microsoft OCR library.
The app will show all detected words in an image and then you can search for a specific word, the words will be highlighted
if it is found. A use case will be when you want to search for a topic in the index page of a big book.
